# 🚀 FastAPI ML Model Deployment

This repository contains a **FastAPI-based implementation** for serving a **Machine Learning model** as a REST API.  
It demonstrates how to wrap an ML model (e.g., classification, NLP, or regression) into a production-ready API for prediction and integration.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load a pre-trained ML model
- Expose it via FastAPI endpoints
- Accept JSON input for inference
- Return model predictions in real-time

This setup mimics how ML models are deployed in modern MLOps workflows.
